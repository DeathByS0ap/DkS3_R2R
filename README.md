Hello and welcome to Rags to Riches!

About R2R:

Rags to Riches was first created by DreadedCone for Dark Souls 1.
I loved this minigame style concept and thought it was amazing, so I set
out to create my own minigame for Dark Souls 3. I thought it would be
an awesome way to give back to the community, especially since the 
PvP in Dark Soul 3 seemed (to me at least) a little too much about
winning and less about having fun. This is my way of trying to get the
community back into the fun part of PvP. It's not about winning or losing,
it's about the journey. I sincerely hope this minigame will help you
get a little more out of your Dark Souls 3 experience.

This program is developed in Python 2.7.11 and uses PyInstaller 3.1 as my
"Exe Compiler" (How I turned it into an EXE file.) This is all open source,
and a link to my github is in the program. Simply click on the link on the
Title Screen. If for whatever reason you can't open the program currently,
here is a link anyway:

For those of you interested, you can tweet me at < @Kirk_CW > should you encounter
any bugs or problems, or if you just want to give me some comments, feedback,
criticism, etc. I welcome it and would love to hear from you!

AUTHOR'S NOTE:
In one of my introduction screens I said I would include a PreMade save for those 
who didn't want to go hunting for every single item. I promise that's on the way,
a small team and I have invested approximately 400 cumulative hours in building
a save file for those on PS4 (since none of us own an Xbox One and PS4 is easy to
access and swap save data). Sorry to all on Xbox One. The save file will most likely
be released with v1.1 or v1.2, it takes a long time to gather everything!
Please bear with me.


Also, I would like to thank you for reading this, and for trying out my program.
This is my first major project and release and I'm happy to have made it.

Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart. Good luck Ashen ones. (Or Champions!)
